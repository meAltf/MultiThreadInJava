-- ExecutorService, Callable, Future, and Thread Pools

- Modern concurrency tools for managing threads efficiently :
- Executor service
- Callable<V> vs Runnable
- Future<V>
- Thread pools (Executors.newFixedThreadPool() etc.


* Issue with new Thread()...
    new Thread(() -> {
        // work
    }).start();
- Works for simpler tasks
- Not scalable for large applications
- No control over thread reuse, return values, cancellation etc.

* Modern solution : Executor service ( A powerful thread pool manager than help you with )
1. Submit tasks
2. Control number of threads
3. Shut down clearly
4. Get return values (Future)
