* Difference b/w Runnable & Callable -
1. Runnable has run() method, but no return.
2. Callable<V> has call() method, returns result & can throw checked exception.

* What does Future.get() -
1. It blocks and waits for the task to finish, then returns the result.

* What happen if the task throws an exception -
1. Calling future.get() will throw ExecutionException, which wraps the original exception.

* the benefit of using thread pools (ExecutorService) over creating threads manually -
1. Reuses thread -> better performance
2. Avoids overhead of creating new Threads repeatedly
3. Allow tasks queueing, timeout, cancellation
