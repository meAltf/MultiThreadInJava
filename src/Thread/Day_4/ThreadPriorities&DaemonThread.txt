1. Thread priority:
- Every thread has a priority (from 1 to 10) that suggests to the JVM schedular that how important thread is.

JVM Schedular/Thread schedular :
- It is a part of the JVM that decides which thread to run next when multiple threads are ready to run.
- It manages CPU time allocation to each thread.
- It consider thread priority, but doesn't guarantee order- ultimately relies on OS's native schedular
- Multiple threads can be Runnable (ready to run), but only one thread (per CPU core) can run at a time.

Priority constants:
Thread.MIN_PRIORITY  = 1
Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5 (default)
Thread.MAX_PRIORITY  = 10
