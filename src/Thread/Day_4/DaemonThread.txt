1. Daemon Threads :
- A Daemon thread runs in the background to support other threads.
- JVM automatically exits- if all non-daemon threads finished, even if daemon threads are running.

-- Common use case:
- Garbage collector
- Background logging
- Monitoring services


-- Rules for Daemon Threads:
1. must call setDaemon(true) before calling start()
2. Can't set a thread as daemon after it has started

Note: JVM ends after main thread finishes. daemon threads are terminated automatically.
