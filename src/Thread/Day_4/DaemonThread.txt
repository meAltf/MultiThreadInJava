1. Daemon Threads :
- A Daemon thread runs in the background to support other threads.
- JVM automatically exits- if all non-daemon threads finished, even if daemon threads are running.

-- Common use case:
- Garbage collector
- Background logging
- Monitoring services


-- Rules for Daemon Threads:
1. must call setDaemon(true) before calling start()
2. Can't set a thread as daemon after it has started

Note: JVM ends after main thread finishes. daemon threads are terminated automatically.

NOTE: if you call setDaemon(true) after start() : throws IllegalThreadStateException

NOTE: we can't make Main thread as daemon thread because it always a user thread.

NOTE: why we use daemon thread:
1. For background tasks that should not block JVM exit, like logging, garbage collector, auto-cleanup, health-checkups etc.
