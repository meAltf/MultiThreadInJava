** Inter-thread Communication â€“
1. wait()
2- notify()
3- notifyAll()

* Why Inter-thread communication -
- Java threads can communicate each other to coordinate tasks.

* Example
- One thread produce data and another consumes the data
- I don't want the consumer run until the producer has made something or produce something
- So for handing these types of scenario, wait() & notify() help.

* Difference notify() & notifyAll()
- notify() : wakes up only one waiting thread (chosen randomly)
- notifyAll() : wakes up all waiting threads but only one will get the lock, rest will wait again.

* Spurious wakeup -
- A spurious wakeup occurs when a thread wakes up from waiting on a conditional variable and finds that the condition is still unsatisfied.

* These all should be used inside synchronized method/block either it will throw- IllegalMonitorStateException.

* Wait() resume automatically without notify(), because it wake up due to spurious wakeup. That's why we always use wait() inside loop not if.
