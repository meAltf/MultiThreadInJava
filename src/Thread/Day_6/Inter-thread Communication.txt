** Inter-thread Communication â€“
1. wait()
2- notify()
3- notifyAll()

* Why Inter-thread communication -
- Java threads can communicate each other to coordinate tasks.

* Example
- One thread produce data and another consumes the data
- I don't want the consumer run until the producer has made something or produce something
- So for handing these types of scenario, wait() & notify() help.



* These all should be used inside synchronized method/block either it will throw- IllegalMonitorStateException.
